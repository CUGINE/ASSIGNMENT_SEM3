   <h43>~BY ANNA TODD~</h3>

    Book Description : 
    Like the first two books in the series, 'After 
    We Fell' was completely consuming. Although the
     back and forth drama between Hardin and Tessa 
     gets to be very irritating, I can't seem to turn away from it. It's like I'm stuck in an abusive relationship with this couple. I know it isn't healthy. I know I should remove myself from the situation...but I just can't do it. 
    After all, maybe they'll change.

<h43>~NANCY MARIE BROWN~</h3>
    <div><p>
        Song of the Vikings focuses on the 
        life and person of Snorri Sturluson, 
        an Icelandic chieftain, politician, 
        historian, and storyteller. His work was 
        crucial for bringing the Norse tradition 
        to Western literature, inspiring several modern writers 
        to turn folklore into fiction.so easliy 3.80.
